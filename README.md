# The-prediction-of-Advertisement-selection-by-particular-internet-user-with-Logistic-Regression
In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

My Contribution:

1.  Cleaning Data, Removing NaN, Histograms, jointplot, pairplot.
2.  Logistic-Regression-Model: Fitting Model to the Training Set.
3.  Train and fit a logistic regression model on the training set
4.  Predicting Test Set: Test Data Accuracy: 91%. Technical scope â€“ Python.
