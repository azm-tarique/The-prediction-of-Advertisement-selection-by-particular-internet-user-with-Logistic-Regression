# The-prediction-of-Advertisement-selection-by-particular-internet-user-with-Logistic-Regression
In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

My Contribution:

1.  Import Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
2.  Create a histogram
3.  Create a jointplot
4.  Create a pairplot 
5.  Predict values for the testing data
6.  Create a classification report for the model
